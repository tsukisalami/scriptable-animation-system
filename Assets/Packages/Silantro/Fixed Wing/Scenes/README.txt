Every scene except Normal/Cessna Manual has the new stability augmentation system running. 

The flight computer will try to counter the rates and level out the aircraft in the pitch and roll axis (i.e bring the angles back to 0, 0).

You can turn off the"leveler" component on the flcs object.

The engines are also slightly overpowered to give you enough speed to get used to the demos.

Let me know if you run into any problems :)
